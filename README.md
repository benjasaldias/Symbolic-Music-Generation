# Symbolic-Music-Generation ðŸª„ðŸŽ¹
Generating symbolic music with a **Variational AutoEncoder** (VAE). The model is trained with a set of scales and melodic patterns presented by Nicolas Slonimsky in his _Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns_.

The project revolves around two main ideas:
* Generation of new scales and melodies.
* Interpolating between two scales through the latent space.
